\chapter{Oh Lord my God}
\startlines
{\sc Oh Lord} my God, when I'm in awesome wonder,
Consider all the World thy hands have made.
I see the Stars I hear the rolling thunder
Thy Power throughout the universe displayed.
 
{\it Then sings my Soul, my Saviour God, To Thee;
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my Soul, my Saviour God, to Thee;
How great Thou art, how great Thou art.}    

And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die --- I scarce can take it in
That on the Cross our burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away our sin. 

When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
and take us home --- what joy shall fi1l our heart!
Then shall we bow in humble adoration,
and there proclaim: My God, how great thou art!
