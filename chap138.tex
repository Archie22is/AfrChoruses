{\sc Blessed} assurance, Jesus is mine! 
	O what a foretaste of glory divine! 
	Heir of salvation, purchase of God, 
	born of his Spirit, washed in his blood. 

{\it	This is my story, this is my song, 
	praising my Saviour all the day long; 
	this is my story, this is my song, 
	praising my Savior all the day long. }

	Perfect submission, perfect delight, 
	visions of rapture now burst on my sight; 
	angels descending bring from above 
	echoes of mercy, whispers of love. 
\hfill({\it Refrain})~~~~~~~~~

	Perfect submission, all is at rest; 
	I in my Saviour am happy and blest, 
	watching and waiting, looking above, 
	filled with his goodness, lost in his love. 
\hfill({\it Refrain})~~~~~~~~~
