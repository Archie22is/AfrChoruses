{\sc Jesus}, keep me near the cross,
There a precious fountain---
Free to all, a healing stream---
Flows from Calv'ry's mountain.

{\it
In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever;
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.}

Near the cross, a trembling soul,
Love and Mercy found me;
There the bright and morning star
Sheds its beams around me.
          \hfill({\it Refrain})~~~~~~~~~

Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadows o'er me.
          \hfill({\it Refrain})~~~~~~~~~

Near the cross I'll watch and wait
Hoping, trusting ever,
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river.
          \hfill({\it Refrain})~~~~~~~~~
