{\sc I'm} going home 
To die no more
I'm going home to die no more .

My heavenly home
Is safe and sound
No pain no death can enter there
Everlasting life is found there.

My heavenly home
Is safe and sound
No thief can ever break in there
Is tighter than anything on earth.

The heavenly life
Is sweet and bright
No bitter can ever destroy your taste
Is brighter than light and
Whiter than show.
