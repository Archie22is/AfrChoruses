{\sc Holy} Jesu, by Thy Passion,
By the woes which none can share,
Borne in more than kingly fashion,
By Thy love beyond compare:
Crucified, I turn to Thee,
Son of Mary, plead for me.

By the Spirit which could render
Love for hate and good for ill,
By the mercy sweet and tender,
Poured upon Thy murderers still:
Crucified, I turn to Thee,
Son of Mary, plead for me.
