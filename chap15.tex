I {\sc will} sing unto the Lord
A joyful song
I will praise His Name
For the Lord is good.

I will follow Jesus
Unto the Cross
I will claim His Grace
For my Jesus saves.

I'll confess unto my God
My sinful ways
And be rest assured
Forgiveness is mine.

Glory be unto our God
For loving us
We'll proclaim His Power
And for ever more.
