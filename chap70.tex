{\sc Cross} of Jesus, Cross of Sorrow,
Where the blood of Christ was shed,
Perfect man on Thee was tortured,
Perfect God on thee has bled.
From the "Holy, Holy, Holy,
We adore Thee, 0 most High",
Down to earth's blaspheming voices
And the shout of "Crucify".
Cross of Jesus, Cross of Sorrow,
Where the Blood of Christ was shed,
Perfect man on thee was tortured,
Perfect God on thee has bled!
