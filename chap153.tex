{\sc  If when} you give the best of your service,
Telling the world that the Savior is come;
Be not dismayed when men don't believe you;
He'll understand, and say, ``Well done.''

{\it
Oh when I come to the end of my journey,
Weary of life and the battle is won;
Carrying the staff and the cross of redemption,
He'll understand and say, ``Well done.''}

Misunderstood, the Savior of sinners,
Hung on the cross; He was God's only Son;
Oh! hear Him call His Father in Heav'n,
``Not my will, but Thine be done.''
