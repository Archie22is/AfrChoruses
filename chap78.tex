{\sc When} storms around are sweeping,
When lone my watch I'm keeping,
'Mid fires of evil falling,
'Mid tempter's voices calling,

Remember me, O mighty One!
Remember me, O mighty One!

When walking on life's ocean,
Control its raging motion;
When from its dangers shrinking,
When in its dread deep sinking,

Oho nkhopole ea matla!
Oho nkhopole ea matla!

When weight of sin oppresses,
When dark despair distresses;
All through the life that's mortal,
And when I pass death's portal,

zundikumbu le Nkosi yam'!
zundikumbu le Nkosi yam'!
