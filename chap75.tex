{\sc All}  for Jesus -- all for Jesus,
This our song shall ever be:
For we have no hope, nor Saviour,
If we have not hope in Thee.

All for Jesus -- Thou will give us
Strength to serve Thee, hour by hour;
None can move us from Thy presence,
While we trust Thy love and power.

All for Jesus -- at thine altar
Thou wilt give us sweet content;
There, dear Lord, we shall receive Thee
In the solemn Sacrament.

All for Jesus -- Thou hast loved us;
All for Jesus -- Thou hast died;
All for Jesus -- Thou art with us;
All for Jesus Crucified.

All for Jesus -- all for Jesus,
This the Church's song must be;
Till, at last, her sons are gathered
One in love and one in Thee.
          \hfill{Amen.}~~~~~~~~~
