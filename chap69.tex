{\sc I adore} Thee, I adore Thee!
Glorious ere the world began;
Yet more wonderful Thou shinest,
Though divine, yet still divinest
In that dying love for man.

I adore Thee, I adore Thee!
Thankful at Thy feet to be;
I have heard Thy accent thrilling,
Lo! I come, for Thou art willing
Me to pardon, even me.

I adore Thee, I adore Thee!
Born of woman, yet Divine;
Stained with sins I kneel before Thee
Sweetest Jesu, I implore Thee,
Make me ever only Thine.
